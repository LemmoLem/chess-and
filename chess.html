    5-best method is almost definitely to store all possible moves for one side rather than compute it when pieces are clicked on, oh well
    6-make it so rather than using value of board use a reference to board!!!!!!
    
    
    so when piece moves shouldnt stay blue imo
    also popup shouldnt be draggable or highlightable and try centre it more still
    
    redo/improve code
    moveing code maybe should just be saving state of the board and then going back to it.
    bit finnicky right now tbh.
    
    finalize having complete chess game done for local
    then work on making so online functionality works
    then work on new game modes
    then work on website functionality and that
    making games, invites, hosting etc
    then done! (well i wont be but in theory i would be yee)
    gamemodes can always be added i guess
